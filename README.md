Multi-Scale Display | [Rock Hack 2014](http://www.agilegeoscience.com/journal/2014/2/5/rock-hack-2014.html)
==============

Geo-scientists must assimilate data of widely different scales.
In this proof-of-concept we demonstrate an interactive display of 3 well logs, a synthetic seismic trace and a core image. 

[Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) is the primary technology used. It depends on [D3](http://d3js.org).
For the zooming and scrolling of the core image we manipulated element styles directly with Javascript. The interesting code is in `index.html`.
